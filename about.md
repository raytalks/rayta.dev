<p> Vegetarian, aspiring vegan ðŸŒ±. 
Iâ€™ve been kickboxing since I was 15 year old, itâ€™s how I like to clear my head ðŸ¥Š.

In my daily job I work as a Scrum Master and a developer in the Platform Team at YoungCapital. I enjoy tinkering with Ruby and I like the DevOpsy part of my job. When Iâ€™m not working I like to organise events for the tech community.
